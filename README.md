# Wyatt Conrad's EPortfolio
SNHU CS-499 Eportfolio

This site showcases the culmination of my work from my Computer Science coursework at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

## Introduction
Welcome, my name is Wyatt Conrad. I have over 25 years of experience in the BPO/CX industry, and I have consistently embraced a "see a need, fill a need" approach to my work. Throughout my career, I have earned a reputation among my managers as the go-to person for finding or developing solutions to problems. I thrive on finding these solutions and taking ownership of tasks, ensuring they are completed efficiently and effectively.

One aspect I take great pride in is my ability to self-teach and acquire new skills. I have proactively sought opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise, resulting in a diverse skill set spanning various areas of the BPO/CX industry. This self-driven approach has allowed me to adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving work environment continuously. In addition, I recently completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at SNHU to legitimize my self-taught skillset.

Throughout my professional career, I have progressed from an agent role to training and training development, to marketing operations, and most recently sales engineering within the BPO/CX space. This progression highlights my dedication to personal and professional growth and my ability to take on increasingly challenging responsibilities.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I am passionate about giving back to the community. I volunteered for a swim league and took the initiative to develop a comprehensive web application to manage all aspects of the league. This system has been successfully utilized since 2016, earning praise from coaches and participants alike. The application manages approximately 800 swimmers and 30+ teams each year. I have also recently added a mobile app, written in .NET Maui, to support both iOS and Android devices for the swimmers, parents, coaches, and administrators.

I am known for my expertise in BPO/CX and have a proven track record of delivering exceptional results. I am excited to explore new opportunities to leverage my skills and experience and drive meaningful impact for an organization.

## Education

## Artifact 
To showcase my software development capabilities, I chose my Android application, which I created during my CS-360 course at SNHU. It is a mobile app built initially using Java that lets users set a goal and track their weight. It also includes a login feature to manage multiple users and enables notifications via Toast and SMS when a user reaches their goal. The app for the course was created during the 2025 C-2 (March-April) term, which ran from March 3, 2025, to April 27, 2025. The completed app used for that course was uploaded to GitHub on April 20, 2025, which was the version submitted as the final project of CS-360.

The app has been converted to Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to follow Google's recommendations. It now also includes dependency injection with the Dagger/Hilt library, along with a Room database to manage the application's data.

## Code Review
Below is a code review completed before converting the mobile app, in which I discuss the shortcomings of the original app and the plans to update it to the latest version available below.
